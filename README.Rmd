Load the necessary packages and read in the data.csv file into R (use an R chunk)

```{r}
# loading common packages, not sure if they'll be used
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

# see if R can read the file
read.csv("data/data.csv")

# asign data to an object
data <- read.csv("data/data.csv")

# view data
view(data)
```

Manipulate the dataframe as necessary so that you can calculate average duration, f0 and intensity as a function of lexical stress (extra points if you can create a plot)

```{r}
# calculate average duration as a function of lexical stress

# calculate average f0 as a function of lexical stress

# calculate average intensity as a function of lexical stress
```
